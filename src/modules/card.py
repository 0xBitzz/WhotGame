20 is a wild card that switches the shape,
14 means general market (everyone pick 1 card),
8 means skip the next person,
5 means for the next person to pick up 3 cards (unless you can defend by playing a 5),
2 means the next person picks up 2 cards, and
1 means hold on because Iâ€™m going to play whatever card I want to next
